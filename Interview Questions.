Interview Quesions.

* Interviewer: Tell me a bit about yourself. Nwoye Collins:

Certainly! I’m Nwoye Collins, a 300-level Applied Statistics student with a deep passion for data analysis. My journey into the world of data began during a six-month internship that completely transformed my perspective on how data can drive decision-making, I got to work with Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

Initially, I saw Excel as just a tool for simple tables and calculations (smiles), but over time, I uncovered its true potential—handling vast datasets and even working alongside SQL! That got me really excited about data analysis, and I started learning more about Power BI for making dashboards and reports.

During my internship, I played a key role in cleaning and organizing datasets, creating reports, and developing insights that helped my team make informed decisions. I also dabbled in Python, using it to automate tasks and streamline workflows.

Now, as I continue my studies, I practice by working on small personal projects, creating dashboards, and learning new data skills. I also enjoy sharing insights and connecting with others in online data communities.

I’m eager to keep learning and gaining hands-on experience, and I look forward to opportunities where I can apply my skills to real-world problems.
